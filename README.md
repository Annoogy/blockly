## Running the samples

In order to run each of the samples, cd into each sample directoy and run: 
```bash
npm install
```

You can then run ``npm run start`` to start a web server. 

All samples are configured to use port ``3000``<br/>
so open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view each sample in the browser.

## Support

Blockly has an active [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/blockly). Please drop by and say hello. Show us your prototypes early; collectively we have a lot of experience and can offer hints which will save you time. We actively monitor the forums and typically respond to questions within 2 working days.

## Get Blockly

You can install the ``blockly`` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blockly).

```
npm install blockly
```


## Importing Blockly

When you import Blockly with ``import * as Blockly from 'blockly';`` you'll get the default modules:
Blockly core, Blockly built-in blocks, the JavaScript generator and the English lang files. 

If you need more flexibility, you'll want to define your imports more carefully: 

#### Blockly Core

```js
import * as Blockly from 'blockly/core';
```

#### Blockly built in blocks

```js
import 'blockly/blocks';
```

#### Blockly Generators
If your application needs to generate code from the Blockly blocks, you'll want to include a generator.

```js
import 'blockly/python';
```
to include the Python generator, you can also import ``blockly/javascript``, ``blockly/php``, ``blockly/dart`` and ``blockly/lua``.

#### Blockly Languages

```js
import * as Fr from 'blockly/msg/fr';
Blockly.setLocale(Fr);
```

To import the French lang files. Once you've imported the specific lang module, you'll also want to set the locale in Blockly.
